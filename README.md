Problem to solve: stacked events

Do I already have something scheduled ?
    - stacked events :o  ==> boolean : isActive ?
If a new scheduling even 'Ã¡rrives', cancel any others ! <===

Day / time

Open Question:

What does my scheduling look like ? time wise
- every day at time X comes ON
- every day at time Y goes OFF


on... of .... on .. off ..


on  on on off on <-- events get messy
